# planos-geologicos
Interactive application specifically designed for mobile devices that allows students and professors to visualize in real-time the relationship between strike and dip parameters with their vector representations and stereographic projections.

**Main Features**

The application is completely self-contained and runs on any smartphone or modern browser without requiring installation or internet connection once loaded. Spanish (plano_geologico_movil.html) and English (geological_plane_mobile.html) versions 
are provided.
It consists of three interactive modules:

**1. Vectors Module**

Displays in real-time:
• Normal vector (perpendicular to the plane) - The most fundamental representation
• Strike vector (horizontal, along the strike line)
• Dip vector (direction of maximum slope within the plane)
• Calculated parameters: dip direction, pole trend, pole plunge

**2. Stereographic Projection**

Simultaneously visualizes:
• Great circle (geological plane trace)
• Pole to plane (projection of the normal vector)
• Reference circles for plunge
• Clearly marked cardinal directions

**3. Interactive 3D Visualization**

Allows:
• Touch rotation of the complete scene
• Geological plane visualization with realistic shading
• Horizontal reference plane for comparison
• All relevant vectors in color code
• Cartesian reference axes (East, North, Up)
